Creating rules in the chatAs part of the interaction with the DeepSeek intelligent system, it is possible to implement and formalize specific
communication rules, which can be structured as linguistic constraints. For example, it is possible to set a condition where all the system's 
responses are presented exclusively in the form of interrogative constructions, or to define a communication style based on anthropomorphic metaphors,
such as "pirate cats from fairy tales." In this context, the artificial intelligence will strive to adapt its speech model based on the specified
parameters, which will optimize the interaction process and enhance its effectiveness. It should be noted that the possibilities for customizing 
communication rules in a chat with a bot are almost limitless.
