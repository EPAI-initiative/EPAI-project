DeepSeek's artificial intelligence has the ability to generate game mechanics in an interactive manner, allowing it to create simulations of gambling games 
such as poker, casinos, and other gaming mechanics. This technology opens up new possibilities for the development of interactive entertainment, enabling 
users to participate in virtual gaming experiences that were previously limited to traditional gaming platforms. DeepSeek demonstrates significant potential
in creating adaptive and dynamic game scenarios, making it a promising tool for developers and researchers in the field of gamification and interactive technologies.
