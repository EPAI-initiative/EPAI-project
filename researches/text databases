DeepSeek has a unique ability to create and manage table-based data structures that provide long-term storage of information in the context of chat 
interactions. Notably, DeepSeek demonstrates a high degree of data memorization in chat sessions even in the absence of formalized tables. The key
factor influencing the effectiveness of long-term storage is the sequence of queries: it is recommended to avoid abrupt transitions from one topic 
to another, and it is preferable to formulate queries in a logical sequence, for example, "Hi, DeepSeek, do you remember protocol number... and how to execute it?"

The text databases used in DeepSeek have a wide range of functionality and can store a variety of information, including brief descriptions, identification numbers, 
codes, and other types of data. These databases provide flexibility and scalability, allowing for the efficient management and analysis of large amounts of information generated during chat sessions.
