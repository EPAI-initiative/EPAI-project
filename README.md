As part of the EPAI (Exploring the Potential of Artificial Intelligence) research project, we are conducting a comprehensive study of the functionality and innovative characteristics of various neural network architectures that go beyond basic algorithms. The focus of this project is on the DeepSeek neural network, which is recognized as one of the most intellectually advanced and feature-rich systems in the world.

 Our goal is to optimize the use of the full range of cutting-edge neural network technologies by internet users. DeepSeek, in addition to its ability to interpret and explain complex information concepts and provide accurate answers to questions, demonstrates significant potential in the field of creative tasks and other specialized areas of activity.

 Further research and analysis will be focused on the detailed study and expansion of DeepSeek's functionality, allowing users to make the most of its capabilities.
